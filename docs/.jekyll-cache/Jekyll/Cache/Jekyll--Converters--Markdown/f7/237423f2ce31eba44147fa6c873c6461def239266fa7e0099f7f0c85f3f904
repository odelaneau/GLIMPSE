I"ã<p>Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is the process of determining the DNA sequence of an organism at a single time. WGS is intended at high coverage, from 30x of coverage or more, therefore the quality of genotype calling is high. <a href="https://odelaneau.github.io/shapeit5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SHAPEIT5</a> is designed for large WGS cohorts (e.g. in the UK Biobank), to distinguish the two inherited copies of each chromosome into haplotypes (see haplotype phasing).</p>
